# Yakalope 

*Chat like an animal*

Yakalope is a multi-protocol web-based chat client with logging and continual presence support. It is being built upon solid existing technologies such as Jabber, Django, Ext.js, JSJaC, and others.

Yakalope is being developed as part of the [Chipmark Senior Project](http://www.chipmark.com/) class at the [University of Minnesota](http://www.umn.edu/)

Please check back as this project progresses.
